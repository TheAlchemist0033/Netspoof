    <string name="agreementTitle">Network Spoofer</string>
    <string name="agreementContents1">I agree to only use Network Spoofer on residential and personal networks with the permission of the network owner.</string>
    <string name="agreementContents2">
        There is no intention for Network Spoofer to include any malicious features.
        This application is a fun demonstration of how vulnerable home networks are to simple attacks,
        with permission of the network owner - DO NOT attempt to use Network Spoofer on any corporate
        or other non-residential networks (eg. at school, university). It becomes very obvious when
        Network Spoofer is being used on a Network, and use of Network Spoofer will be considered
        malicious hacking by network administrators.
